# bank_churn_analysis

Customer churn often poses a threat to the profitability of banks. The reasons for churn are not always obvious, which makes the problem even more acute.

To prevent churn, it is necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of customer data, which will allow conclusions to be drawn about the factors contributing to this phenomenon.

This project aims to identify relevant problematic areas of the bank through the analysis and segmentation of data about departing customers. The project goals include:

1) Studying and preprocessing the dataset of customers.
2) Conducting exploratory data analysis, including creating a portrait of the typical customer.
3) Testing statistical hypotheses about the influence of certain factors on customer churn.
4) Segmenting the data to identify the most churn-prone groups.
5) Providing recommendations regarding the most risky segments.
